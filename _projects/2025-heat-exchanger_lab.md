In my thermodynamics lab, I tested out a heat exchanger setup by altering the operating conditions in an effort to observe potential changes in device performance.

A heat exchanger is a device that transfers heat between the flow of two fluids that are operating at different temperatures without the fluids physically mixing with each other. This is done so that one fluid will heat up after passing through the heat exchanger, while the other fluid will cool down. Heat exchangers are typically used in refrigeration and AC units by using coolant to keep the air cold.

Here's a view of the cross sectional area of a heat exchanger, where tubes will bring in two different fluids at different temperatures which will flow through the heat exchanger, transferrring heat via the metal barrier separating the two.

In this lab, the heat exchanger had a hot water source maintained by an attached immersion heaters in addition to a cold water source kept cool via ice and insulation surrounding the container. The two fluids were differentiated by food dye, with red coloring for the hot reservoir and blue coloring for the cold reservior.
The heat exchanger has a known mass flow rate of 210 gal/hr, so we tested the effects of same direction vs cross direction flow in addition to altering the initial temperature difference between the two reservoirs.

Here are images of the initial setup:
