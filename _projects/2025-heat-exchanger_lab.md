In my thermodynamics lab, I tested out a heat exchanger setup by altering the operating conditions in an effort to observe potential changes in device performance.

A heat exchanger is a device that transfers heat between the flow of two fluids that are operating at different temperatures without the fluids physically mixing with each other. This is done so that one fluid will heat up after passing through the heat exchanger, while the other fluid will cool down. Heat exchangers are typically used in refrigeration and AC units by using coolant to keep the air cold.

![Heat Exchanger Cross Section]({{ "/assets/images/Heat_Exchanger_Cross_Section.JPG" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
Here's a view of the cross sectional area of a heat exchanger, where tubes will bring in two different fluids at different temperatures which will flow through the heat exchanger, transferrring heat via the metal barrier separating the two.

In this lab, the heat exchanger had a hot water source maintained by an attached immersion heaters in addition to a cold water source kept cool via ice and insulation surrounding the container. The two fluids were differentiated by food dye, with red coloring for the hot reservoir and blue coloring for the cold reservior.

The heat exchanger has a known mass flow rate of 210 gal/hr, so we tested the effects of same direction vs cross direction flow in addition to altering the initial temperature difference between the two reservoirs.

![Same Direction Flow]({{ "/assets/images/Same_Flow.JPG" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
Here is an image of the experimental setup with a same-directional flow.
Same directional flow means that both fluids are moving in the same direction (in this image, both move from the left side to the right side).

![Cross Direction Flow]({{ "/assets/images/Cross_Flow.JPG" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
Here is an image of the experimental setup with a cross-directional flow.
Cross directional flow means that the fluids are moving in directions opposite to each other (in this image, the blue fluid moves from left to right, while the red fluid moves from right to left).

![Schematics]({{ "/assets/images/Schematic.JPG" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
Here are drawn schematics of both the same directional flow setup and the cross directional flow setup, where Tc refers to the cold reservior, Th refers to the hot reservoir, and m dot refers to the mass flow rates through the exchanger. Since the hot reservior is maintained via an immersion heater, there is a rate of heat flow Qh into the hot reservior. The two pumps also run on electrical power, so there is a rate of work transfer into both pumps as a result.

![CV Diagram]({{ "/assets/images/CV-Diagram.JPG" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-l}
Specifically looking at the heat exchanger as a Control Volume, we can assume that it is adiabatic (no heat transfer with surroundings), with no work rate since there are no moving parts (i.e. no shaft work, no rotors, etc.). We can also assume steady state flow, where the mass flow rate into the heat exchanger equals the mass flow rate out of the heat exchanger.
