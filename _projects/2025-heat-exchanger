In my thermodynamics lab, I tested out a heat exchanger setup by altering the operating conditions in an effort to observe potential changes in device performance.

A heat exchanger is a device that transfers heat between the flow of two fluids that are operating at different temperatures without the fluids physically mixing with each other. This is done so that one fluid will heat up after passing through the heat exchanger, while the other fluid will cool down. Heat exchangers are typically used in refrigeration and AC units by using coolant to keep the air cold.

Here is a sketch of a the heat exchanger setup:
